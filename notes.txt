Create docker image with
`docker buildx build . -f <name> -t <name>:latest`

When delivering, create all images with `docker save` (???) and put them in `images/` subfolder
Then write how to launch each image:
 1. import image
 2. export necessary variables
 3. docker run command

Run docker images with

export BROKER_PORT=20000
export SERVER_PORT=20100
export CLIENT_PORT=20200
export BROKER_ADDRESS='192.168.0.100'
export SERVER_NAME='Rock-Paper-Scissors'

docker run --pid=host -v .:/Client/logs -it client ${BROKER_ADDRESS} ${BROKER_PORT}
docker run --pid=host -v .:/Broker/logs -p ${BROKER_PORT}:20000/udp broker
docker run --pid=host -v .:/RPSServer/logs -p ${SERVER_PORT}:20100/tcp rps_server ${SERVER_NAME} ${SERVER_ADDRESS} ${SERVER_PORT} ${BROKER_ADDRESS} ${BROKER_PORT}
