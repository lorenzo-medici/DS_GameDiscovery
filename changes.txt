### BROKER

 - RWLock is still applied to internal dictionary


### SERVER-BROKER

 - since the broker is containerized it cannot know the "global" address of the server. For this reason the server
    will send a string formatted as '<serverName>|<serverAddress>|<serverPort>'. Note that the second part is what
    the broker saves as address string, so it will need to split only on the first '|' character to get the server
    name and address string to store
